# Student Performance Prediction

## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts student performance using different machine learning algorithms and compares their accuracy.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains student-related features that influence academic outcomes. After preprocessing, it was split into training and testing sets.  

## ⚙️ Models Implemented  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

## 📊 Results  

| Model               | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression  | 0.8987         | 0.8915        |
| Decision Tree        | 1.0000         | 0.9995        |
| Random Forest        | 1.0000         | 0.9975        |
| Gradient Boosting    | 1.0000         | 0.9985        |
| SVM                  | 0.9146         | 0.9240        |
| KNN                  | 0.9921         | 0.9820        |

## 📌 Conclusion  
- Tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) achieved near-perfect accuracy.  
- SVM and Logistic Regression performed well but slightly lower.  
- KNN also showed excellent performance.  

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Apply hyperparameter tuning.  
- Analyze feature importance.  
- Test with larger datasets.
